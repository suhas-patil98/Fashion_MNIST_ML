# Fashion_MNIST_ML_R_Project
Supervised Learning | Using R, Rstudio								             September 2018

Objective: Compare classification models for image classification from feature set of 784 pixelâ€™s darkness value. 

Data Transformation: Near zero variance and Principal component analysis for 93.6% reduction in features.

Classification Models: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine

Results: We successfully managed to get 90% accuracy in SVM model, and 79% accuracy in LDA with fastest runtime.
